# HGT Bookkeeper

Professional transaction formatting for self-employed bookkeeping.

## What This Tool Does

**hgt-bookkeeper** bridges the gap between payment processors and your accounting software. It formats complex payment data into clean, properly-structured double-entry transactions ready for import.

## Why This Exists

Payment processors like Stripe have complex fee structures, timing differences between charges and payouts, and tax implications that are tedious to enter manually into accounting software. This tool handles that complexity for you.

## Quick Start

1. [Install and configure](getting-started.md)
2. [Run your first import](tutorials/first-import.md)
3. [Understand the accrual method](tutorials/understanding-accrual.md)

## Philosophy

Part of the [Hunt Gather Trade](https://huntgathertrade.substack.com) methodology: build proper systems from the start, understand your tools, own your data.

This tool complements GnuCash, Quicken, Beancount, or any double-entry accounting system. It doesn't replace them—it makes them easier to use for self-employment income.
