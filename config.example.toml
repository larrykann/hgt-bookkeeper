# HGT Bookkeeper Configuration Template
# Copy this file to config.toml and edit with your actual GnuCash account names

# Accounting Flow:
# 1. On charge: Record revenue (gross), fees (expense), net to Stripe Balance
# 2. On charge: Accrue tax liability (expense + liability accounts)
# 3. On stripe_fee: Reduce Stripe Balance, record billing expense
# 4. On payout: Move from Stripe Balance to Checking sub-accounts
#    - Withholding sub-accounts get tax amounts (mirrors liabilities)
#    - Available for Draw gets the remainder
# 5. Liabilities remain until you manually pay quarterly taxes
